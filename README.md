# Halo Formation Simulation
1. Open the Python Notebook File
2. Make the necessary changes - file path, your animation name, among others
3. The simulation is ready to run

The simulation is of 100 frames of redshift value for 32^3 particles forming halo clusters. The python notebook consists of 2 codes, one with and one without the axes.
Since the original code was run on Jupyter Notebook, I recommend to use the same. The rendering time depends from ~5 minutes to ~15 minutes.
