# P(k) Plot Simulation
1. Open the Python Notebook File
2. Make the necessary changes - file path, your animation name, among others
3. The simulation is ready to run

The simulation is of 100 frames of redshift values from 100 to 1 for P(k) vs k Plot. The python notebook consists of the code to run this plot.
Since the original code was run on Jupyter Notebook, I recommend to use the same. The rendering time depends from ~1 minutes to ~2 minutes.
